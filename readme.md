ID1019 - A functional programming course given at KTH. In this repository you'll find directories exploring the functionalities of Elixir e.g. Pattern Matching through a derivatives calculator and a mathematical evaluator which simplifies mathematical expressions. Moreover, there are algorithms that are more complex such as the huffman encoding algorithm, approximations of Pi through a Monte Carlo simulation as well as a solution to the Advent of Code problem posed December 2022.
